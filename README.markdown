# Drupal Headjs

Drupal Headjs is a module for Drupal 6 which attempts to integrate the great head.js javascript library unobtrusively, without requiring any additional configuration or edits to existing javascript files

Despite apparently working and having no conflicts with a number of contrib modules others and some core Drupal functionality like collapsible fieldsets get broken. If you are interested please fork this and help me figure it out!

* Requires [https://github.com/headjs/headjs/](head.js 0.2+)
* Docs: -none yet-

Drupal contrib modules tested ok:

  * Fivestar
  * jQuery UI
  * jQuery Update
  * Quicktabs
